Geoff Scheid (gscheid3) - All Roles

## 1st Project Choice
### Topic
Crohn's Disease Patient Web App

### Project Type
End User Application

### Problem Summary
As a patient with Crohn's Disease, I know how difficult it can be for patients to track their symptoms and communicate to their doctors the frequency and severity of those symptoms. 

### Proposed Solution
Build a patient-facing web application to track the frequency and severity of their Crohn's-related symptoms leveraging connection to a FHIR server to pull and push patient data.

### Potential Blockers (provide mitigation ideas if possible)
* Encouraging patients to use the application. This could be done through in-browser reminders or emails.
* Encouraging providers to read and make use of the data. A professional-looking report with clear data representation may encourage providers to take the data seriously.

## 2nd Project Choice
### Topic
Obesity Population Heatlh Management Tool

### Project Type
Public Health Data Analytics

### Problem Summary
Obesity is a major factor in developing chronic diseases as well as increased morbidity. With the increase in accountable care organizations health systems need to find a way to manage their patient population in order to lower the amount of obesity.

### Proposed Solution
This tool will aim to use FHIR bulk data export to develop a population health tool for clinicians to monitor the obesity levels for their patient population. The tool will be accessible via a web application that will allow insight into the obese population.

### Potential Blockers (provide mitigation ideas if possible)
* Presenting the data with enough clarity to communicate the story without glossing over the nuanced details will be a challenge. This tool may need multiple views available to the user in order to provide a complete picture.
* Presenting the data on the obese population does not by itself reduce obesity. This tool may need to attempt to find subpopulations where obesity has been reduced and provide insights as to the cause of the reduction.

## 3rd Project Choice
### Topic
Hypertension Management App

### Project Type
End User Web Application

### Problem Summary
Hypertension management must extends beyond managing the disease through medication and doctor visits. To successfully stay on top of the disease, you must ensure all appointments are kept, exercise, eat a healthy diet and stay informed about the disease itself.

### Proposed Solution
Develop a web application that tracks important attributes of people with Hypertension. The application should include Login/Registration, appointment scheduler, track exercise and diet/nutrition.

### Potential Blockers (provide mitigation ideas if possible)
* Encouraging patients to use the application. This could be done through in-browser reminders or emails.
* Encouraging providers to read and make use of the data. A professional-looking report with clear data representation may encourage providers to take the data seriously.
