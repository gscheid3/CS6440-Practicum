\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Accomplishments}
Over the past two weeks, I have accomplished several of the tasks identified in the last sprint:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Build the dashboard in Angular using chart.js
    \item Build an Angular form to create, read, update, and delete data
    \item Connect the Angular dashboard to Firebase and deploy to the web
\end{itemize}

\section{Challenges}
Much progress has been made since the last sprint, but there are still several challenges before the project is complete.
The prototype web app is deployed and functional, but its look and feel could be significantly improved.
Connection to Firebase has allowed for persistent storage of user data, but moving that data back and forth is still a challenge.

\section{Sprint Plans}
Looking ahead to the final week of development, I intend to focus the remaining time on completing the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extend the Angular form input to track more data
    \item Add more charts or graphs to visually display that new data
    \item Consider data interoperability for output
\end{itemize}
