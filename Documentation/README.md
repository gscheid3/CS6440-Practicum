## Using Crohn's Symptom Tracker
This web app has been developed to allow a user to tracker stool-related symptoms of Crohn's disease in an easy-to-visualize dashboard.
The user is able to add a new symptom, view and change previously entered symptoms, and delete symptoms.

### Adding a New Symptom
The user can click on the "New Symptom" button on the top right of the screen to add a new symptom.
A modal popup opens on the center of the screen with input fields for the date, stool type, bleeding, pain level, and notes. Once the user has entered their desired values, the user can click on "OK" at the bottom left of the modal popup. Once saved, the symptom will populate in the Recent Sypmtoms list ordered by date. Any values entered for stool type and pain level will also populate on their respective graphs.

### Viewing & Changing a Symptom
The user can navigate to any previously entered symptom in the list of Recent Symptoms on the left side of the screen and single click on the desired symptom in the list. A new modal popup will open in the center of the screen with the previously entered values for each input. The user can modify any of the values on the modal. To save these new values, the user can click on "OK" at the bottom left of the modal popup. The new values for the symptom will be displayed in the symptom summary on the list of Recent Symptoms and the dashboard graphs will be updated. The user can cancel the changes by clicking "Cancel" at the bottom of the modal popup.

### Deleting a Symptom
The user can navigate to any previously entered symptom in the list of Recent Symptoms on the left side of the screen and single click on the desired symptom in the list. A new modal popup will open in the center of the screen with the previously entered values for each input. The user can delete this symptom by clicking on the trashcan icon on the bottom right of the modal popup. The symptom will be removed from the list of Recent Symptoms, and the dashboard graphs will be updated.
