\title{CS 6440 - Intro to Health Informatics:\\Sprint 4 - Status Check In 2}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Accomplishments}
Over the past two weeks, I have accomplished the following tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Completed a refresher course on Angular fundamentals focusing on reactive forms 
    \item Investigated an appropriate backend tool that can assist with user authentication and data storage
    \item Investigated libraries featuring charts and graphs to be used on the project dashboard
\end{itemize}

\section{Challenges}
I have not made as much progress as anticipated by this point in the semester.
While I have most of the individual components that I will need to utilize in my web application,
I have not yet assembled those components into a usable prototype.
My primary challenge over the last two weeks has been time management as work, other courses, and personal commitments have taken a priority.

\section{Sprint Plans}
Looking ahead to the next two weeks, I intend to focus more time on this project in order to catch up towards completion.
For this upcoming sprint, I intend to complete the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Build the Angular forms for data input and modification
    \item Assemble the chart and graph components of the dashboard
    \item Connect the prototype to Firebase to serve as the backend
\end{itemize}
